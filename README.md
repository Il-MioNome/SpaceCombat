REMEMBER:
- When you'll open the ".exe" file it will be slow ONLY the FIRST time
- This game is been developed by a 13yrs old boy, so it's not perfect. I'm trying to develop a good 2D python game

WHAT'S NEW:
- Clean code
- Game in the ".exe" file!


In case of problem try the "Manual installation" and then re-try or try the code in the "Game code" folder.

Down here there's the tutorial

Install the module clicking on "install_python.bat". Check "Add python to PATH" and leave "pip" enabled.
Then let the installation finish, close the CMD and open "install_requirements.bat".
Let the download finish...

or if you want to install everything manually

do "windows + r", type "cmd" and click enter. Then write: "curl -o python_installer.exe https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.8/python-3.11.8-amd64.exe"
Check "Add python to PATH" and leave "pip" enabled. After write in the same CMD: "python -m pip install --upgrade pip"
After all write: "pip install pgzero" (without the "")...

...re-open the "main.py" and you can play!
